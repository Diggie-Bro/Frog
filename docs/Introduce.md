#### Into the ~~unknown~~ frogramming~
Hi, everyone. And thanks for giving attention to here. 
This Programming Language, Froglang is Object-Oriented PL and also 
***OPEN SOURCE*** for using, or customizing. We dream the world that
everyone contribute in entire IT industry. So, we think the most 
important thing to make our dream come true is **Easy Coding**. Artists,
Students, Teachers, even workers can use our PL to make there dream as 
Digital way.  
  
For example, think you're making a spreadsheet file of millions of data files. If you enter that data by your hands,
maybe this work will be your last work :D. However, you can use 
programming for this. As you know, computer can operate billions of operations *IN THE BLINK*. **Remember**, there is
lots of differences between who know programming and not.

#### Why Frogramming?

- Super **EASY** ðŸ˜ƒ
- Hyper **Customization** ðŸ‘€
- Cool **Versatile** ðŸ’ª

#### Coding: Hello, World!

- JAVA

```
package com.frog.program

class program {
    public static void main() {
        System.out.println("hello world");
    }
}
```

- Python

```
print("hello world")
```

- C/C++

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main {
    printf("hello world");
    return 0;
}
```

- **FROGRAMMING**

``` python
import io

main {
    run print("hello world");
}
```

You might think python is better than froglang. But, don't worry.
***Froglang have lots of unique, also perfect grammar you'll like it.***


Keep going, and thanks you for joining us.
